TODO: look into creating our own peerjs server instead of using the peerjs cloud hosted server, in order to avoid mixed content warnings (which we are currently avoiding by loading unsafe scripts from our prod website in Chrome, by clicking the shield icon in the address bar). one easy option might be to use the one-click deploy-to-heroku button on peerjs's github. helpful links:

another option is to try other more mature webRTC wrappers like simplewebrtc.com, since peerjs hasnt been updated in years
